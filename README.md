# Full-stack-open-part-9-typescript

[Part 9](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part9) of 11 in the series.

This part concentrates on Typescript. First there are two simple projects created, one in React and one in NodeJS.
These both introduce some of the core concepts of Typescript, and these are two completely separate projects. 

After that we create a bit larger application for storing patient data, and this uses Typescript for both the front end and the backend.
